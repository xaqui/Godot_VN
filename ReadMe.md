This is a clone of the initial commit of [this repo](https://gitlab.com/Code_Man/Godot_VN).

Here is the original readme.txt:
>Godot VN 1.0 readme:
>
>What this is and can do:
>This is a visual novel framework for the godot game engine, simliar to renpy.
>It displays an image and with optional background sound trough different pages until changed.
>The user can switch between pages back and forth with mouse buttons at the bottom and optionally the keyboard.
>A text on every page is displayed at the bottom, with custom fonts with configurable sizes and colors.
>Per page sound can also be played, only one at a time however, it will be stopped once the player changes to a new page.
>If you need multiple sounds, you will have to mix them yourself with a tool such as audicity.
>In addition every page can have a number of objects shown in front of the background.
>The player can also be forced to make a choice of possible responses provided trough a menu that will skip to some position.
>Data is stored in a xml file and can be edited with the builtin editor or by hand optionally.
>Keep an eye out for updates.
>
>Warning: Even though this has been tested you can never be certain when a bug sneaks in.
>Be sure to keep backups of data.xml that is inside the dialogue folder of godot vn.
>
>What this can not do, yet:
>More sophisticated main menu: more structured info, like website url credits and bonus menus.
>Customizeable interface: such as themes and custom buttons.
>Decent saving: saving will save page number you were on for now and thats it.
>Animations: such as fading and moving and animated items or backgrounds.
>Advanced scripting: right now you are limited to simple jumps based on the choices.
>Configurable sound parameters: such as fading and volume.
>Better help: Current tooltips and help dialog are not much, but should be sufficient given the simple nature of this program.
>Feedback on saving files: Right now it will simply silently save/open files, if an error happens it wont complain.
>Clean up code base: some things are messy, modding is not currently advised.
>
>How you may use it:
>You may use it in any way you like, including closed source and commercial use.
>However without no warranty from me nor the godot developers is given, use at own risk.
