## Godot VN 2.0

This is a fork of [this repo](https://gitlab.com/Code_Man/Godot_VN).

This is  a Visual Novel framework for the Godot game engine, similar to RenPy.
It displays an image and with optional background sound trough different pages until changed.
The user can switch between pages back and forth with mouse buttons at the bottom and optionally the keyboard.
A text on every page is displayed at the bottom, with custom fonts with configurable sizes and colors.
Per page sound can also be played, only one at a time however, it will be stopped once the player changes to a new page.
The player can also be forced to make a choice of possible responses provided trough a menu that will skip to some position.
Data is stored in a xml file and can be edited with the builtin editor or by hand optionally.

### To Do
*   Text Animations.
*   BBCode.
*   User manual.
*   Configurable sound parameters: such as fading and volume.
*   Customizable interfaces: such as themes and custom buttons.
*   Advanced script integration: right now it's limited to simple jumps based on the choices.
