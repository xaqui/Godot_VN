## Godot VN 2.0

This is a fork of [this repo](https://gitlab.com/Code_Man/Godot_VN).

This is  a Visual Novel framework for the Godot game engine, similar to RenPy.<br>

### Features
*   Godot Engine v3.2 compatible.
*   It displays an image and with optional background sound through different pages until changed.
*   The user can switch between pages back and forth with mouse buttons at the bottom and optionally the keyboard.
*   A text on every page is displayed at the bottom, with custom fonts with configurable sizes and colors.
*   Per page sound can also be played, only one at a time however, it will be stopped once the player changes to a new page.
*   The player can also be forced to make a choice of possible responses provided trough a menu that will skip to some position.
*   Data is stored in a xml file and can be edited with the built-in editor or by hand optionally.
*   Game progress can be saved and loaded.

### To Do
*   Text Animations.
*   BBCode.
*   User manual.
*   Add loading saved games function from main menu.
*   Configurable sound parameters: such as fading and volume.
*   Customizable interfaces: such as themes and custom buttons.
*   Advanced script integration: right now it's limited to simple jumps based on the choices.
